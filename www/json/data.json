By the time I took it, I didn't know everything that was going to happen to me.\nFirst I ended up in Villanueva de La Ca√±ada, a small village in the province of Madrid that turned out to be full of religious extremists. For this reason it was not easy to make friends there.\nAfter that I moved to the capital, Madrid, and there's where the fun begun. Madrid is honestly a city in which you cannot get bored. It's full of parks, bars, clubs, museums and restaurants, and the people of Madrid are very welcoming. If only the city had a proper bike lane, I would certainly live there for ever."
